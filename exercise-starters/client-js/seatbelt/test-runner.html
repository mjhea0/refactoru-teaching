	<h2>Test Runner</h2>
	<p>This is a "test runner," a simple page whose only job is to launch your tests. You can hit refresh to reload the tests.</p>
	<p>Three scripts are included:
	<ul>
		<li><b>src.js</b> - Your source code. This is the code that will be running on your website, and you wish to test. In this exercise, the isEven function has already been written for you.</li>
		<li><b>test-framework.js</b> - Your testing library, such as Jasmine or Mocha. Here we are using a (very) tiny home-made test framework. Do not edit this file.</li>
		<li><b>spec.js</b> - A separate file that calls methods from the test framework on your source code in order to "assert" that your source code behaves as expected. <b>Write your unit tests in this file.</b></li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Open console to see results.</p>
